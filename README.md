# My Scala.js playground

Electron needs to be installed, a pre-built binary can be found [here](https://github.com/atom/electron/releases).

Furthermore, the following package installations were required on my system:

- nodejs
- phantomjs

The application can be launched by starting sbt and typing `backend/preStart`. After that the `scalajs-test` executable can be run.
